# Building new web component

Currently the processs is manual, but will automate this process. 

1. Copy `package/Template` and paste inside `/package` folder 
2. Rename the folder `Template copy` accordingly (i.e. Header)
3. Edit package.json (Header) and rename package name accordingly, i.e

```json
{
  "name": "@perkd-ui/header",
  "private": true,
  ... 
}
 
```
